Introduction: 
A job portal, also known as a career portal, is a center of information that allows job seekers to research and apply for positions with numerous registered companies. The goal of an online job portal is to create or construct an online search portal for job seekers. The system project is a web application that can be accessed from anywhere with the right login credentials. For job searchers, the system would serve as an Online Job Portal. Job seekers must be able to log in and upload their resumes (CV). Companies and organizations can also log in and access or search any of the information that job seekers have posted. 

I made such an online job portal app called “NSU CPC” which has 2 Apps. One is for the students & another one is for admin. The “NSU CPC” Student app is only for the North South University Student. The Student of NSU can see the job, can apply in their desired job through this portal. First, they have to login Their app. If they have no account, they must sign up & they need to registration for using the application. After that they can login the application. After the login they see all the recent jobs & can download the pdf of the job description. By clicking my profile, they can go their user profile & update their information which they did not provide in the registration part. They can update their personal Information, Academic Information, Contact Information, their Experiences & their Specialty as well. Then they can see their full profile. Students also reset their password by their email if they forget their password. 

 “NSU CPC” Admin App is only for the administration who relate to NSU CPC. Here user account is limited. They cannot sign up by themselves. Their account will be opened by the higher authority of NSU CPC. After registering their information by authority, they can login their app. But they have the option to forget their password if they forget their password or wish. The admin can post a job. When a company want to offer a job, they need to contact with NSU CPC. And after that the admin can post company’s job description through a pdf file.

Data Management: For the management of the data, Firebase Realtime database has been used which is a NoSQL database. For Login & Registration Authentication used Firebase Authentication. And here used Firebase Storage for Uploading PDF.  
Here no local Database is used. But in future for the purpose of developing the app local database can be used.  


Design Pattern: I tried to follow my Figma prototype design pattern. But the shortage of time I cannot follow that properly. Many of the features could not be implemented. But In future I will try to complete this application according to the Figma Prototype.


Roadblocks: While working with this application, there were many roadblocks which slowed down the rate of work. It takes to many times to displaying the user data. First-time Firebase database did not connect properly & I could not disconnect them for the further give the connection. So, I had to redesign the app & create another Database. So, it takes too many times to redesign the application. It is not a common concept in this era. This is new for us. So, I must research more & more to implement the features & the number of resources were not enough. I struggled too much to find the proper resources for implement all the features. That is why the project was not completed. But in Future I will try to implement all the features of this app & try to launch it in google play store.
